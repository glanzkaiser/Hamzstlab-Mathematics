# Hamzstlab-Mathematics
Real time plotting library for Mathematics learning.

## Dependencies
[imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
[implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot)

Don't worry too much, in this repository we already have the dependencies so no need for downloading from another source, but it is encouraged to read both the repositories above to learn more.

# Example

We have created a file `examples/PilotProject/`, from this directory open terminal and type

```
make
./main
```

This `PilotProject` will plot stairstep function, sine function, and a histogram that we can interact with.

You can see that it is really fun, compared to the an image library like gnuplot, you can do more here with Imgui and Implot.
