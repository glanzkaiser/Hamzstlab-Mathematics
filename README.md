# Hamzstlab-Mathematics
Real time plotting library for Mathematics learning.

## Dependencies
[imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
[implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot)
[implot3d](https://github.com/brenocq/implot3d)

In this repository we already have the dependencies downloaded so no need for downloading again, but it is encouraged to read both the repositories above to learn more.

# Example

We have created an example that can be easily compiled and executed at `examples/PilotProject/`, from this directory open terminal and type

```
make
./main
```

This `PilotProject` will plot stairstep function, sine function, and a histogram that we can interact with.

You can see that it is really fun, compared to the an image library like gnuplot, you can do more here with Imgui and Implot.
